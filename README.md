Scala support for LR plugins SDK

In order for Scala plugins to work it is required to have SCALA_HOME environment variable properly set. 
Testing was performed with Scala 2.10.2 although there should be no problems with using it with any Scala version > 2.9

As for now only portlets and hooks can be written in Scala.
